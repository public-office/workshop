        <p>In the artistic and cultural lexicon of the short twentieth century, the term ‘concrete’ recurs repeatedly. A simple keyword search through any library or museum catalogue is likely to bring up hundreds of references to painters, sculptors, composers, graphic designers and poets who were working in dozens of cities around the world. High up on any list you would find mention of Konkrete Kunst from Zürich, or from the so-called School of Ulm in Germany.1 The slim, single-issue magazine Art Concret, published in Paris in 1930, would also show up, as well–possibly–as Musique concrète.2 In São Paulo, artists and poets united beneath the banner of Concretismo, although it would be mistaken to exclude the splinter group from Rio de Janeiro who preferred the term Neoconcretismo.3 Meanwhile, in Buenos-Aires, Marxist artists had gathered under the name Concreto-Invención.4 Search again and you will quickly come to references to ‘concrete poetry’ in Scotland, or konkret poesi, as it was called in Sweden.

The word entered art discourse at some point during the 1920s in post-revolutionary Russia: ‘Concreteness is the object in itself […] Concreteness is the sum of experience […] Concreteness is form’, declared, for instance, a group of painters in the catalogue of the First Discussional Exhibition of Associations of Active Revolutionary Art in 1924.5 The suggestion that it might have been all of those things at once gives an indication of just how elastic the idea of a ‘concrete art’ could be, even from the outset. And over the course of the decades the word was stretched and pummelled to suit a not insubstantial spectrum of agendas and ideologies. The term is still used to this day, although less commonly by artists themselves. It has become more of a curatorial designation often promoted by museums whose mission it is to perpetuate the aesthetic.6

The era, however, when international interest in concrete art was at its greatest was from the 1950s to roughly the mid-1960s. We might take 1951 – the year the Swiss artist and designer Max Bill won the international prize for sculpture at the first São Paulo Biennial for his work Tripartite Unity (1948–9) – as the moment that ushered in the period of greatest engagement with concrete aesthetics on both sides of the Atlantic.7 Bill's winning contribution consisted of a single loop of stainless steel that had been parted and torqued into a complicated, upright form that enveloped an interior space. Standing at over a metre in height, it was interpreted as a bold endorsement of an artistic outlook that appeared both open to and informed by the latest innovations in post-war technology. Bill's approach to art would go on to have a substantial knock-on effect among Brazilian artists, and his influence undoubtedly contributed to the formation in São Paulo of Grupo Ruptura the following year. Led by Waldemar Cordeiro, they espoused a complete break with expressionist traditions within Brazilian painting. Later, in 1954, another collective established themselves in Rio, who called themselves Grupo Frente. The impact of these two movements was widespread, and informed the outlook not just of artists, but also contemporary poets, musicians and landscape designers, many of whom engaged in a fruitful intellectual exchange with their European counterparts.

Pinpointing the period when interest began to wane is more controversial. Perhaps 1964, the year of the final issue of the Constructivist and De Stijl inspired journal, Structure: Annual on the New Art, might serve as one ending.8 The military coup in Brazil that same year, which upturned the country's political landscape and led to the withdrawal of numerous civil liberties, forced artists to renegotiate their relationship to their audience, and to rethink the role that art might serve in a society in which repression and state violence were increasingly the norm. In Brazil, the concrete aesthetic barely survived. Even in Western Europe, much of the earlier heat went out of the discussions. Supporters of concrete art became more defensive, and, within the art world at large, their conversations were increasingly marginalized.9 The ascendancy of American visual art during this era certainly had its role to play. It is well known that abstract artists in the United States, including Donald Judd and Frank Stella, actively distanced themselves from Europeans who had espoused the concrete moniker, in spite of the fact that their work covered surprisingly similar ground.10 Meanwhile, American critics ushered in an alternative discourse that revolved around concepts such as ‘literalism’, ‘medium-specificity’, or ‘post-minimalism’, and, as ever-larger numbers of artists and intellectuals from outside the United States internalized the terminology of this new language, so a wider familiarity with the legacies of concrete art waned. Simultaneously, by around 1970, a number of those critics and artists who had endorsed concrete art a decade earlier were now pursuing their interests under different headings, such as information theory, computer art or New Tendencies.11

The question remains, then, what it meant to designate a work of art as concrete. The issue feels timely, thanks to the increasing recognition – particularly among Anglophone historians of twentieth-century art – that the discipline's research focus has still not engaged adequately with modernist traditions outside of Western Europe and North America. In the light of this, the concrete aesthetic, which otherwise might appear retardataire (at least within a more narrowly conceived and predominantly North American context), is attracting renewed levels of attention. It is increasingly appreciated as a term that enjoyed genuine international currency during the early post-war period. Moreover, the lineages that concrete art forged generate significantly different vectors to those that have been canonized by more familiar modernist discourses. These are histories with different geographies – ones in which Latin America, for instance, plays a much more prominent role. For many artists across South and Central America, ‘the concrete’ provided an invaluable resource by which they could fashion a geographically distinct mode of modernism through the ‘cannibalization’ of European precedents.12 The Brazilian poet Haroldo de Campos once testified to the importance of concretist aesthetics for writers in his country, for instance, by pointing out that authors who, up to that point, had been classified as working in a peripheral literature, were suddenly able to appropriate the entire linguistic code, ‘reclaiming it as their whole patrimony’.13 It projected them onto an international, universal plane and made the Brazilian example the condition of possibility for conceptualizing the radical new poetic. Such was the sense of optimism that the concrete afforded. Thus, if it is our ambition to establish a stronger historical grasp of what was meant by the term, then these factors need to be taken into consideration. In any case, it would be a fundamental mistake to presume that there was ever somewhere in the world a quintessentially concrete art practice, which came to be increasingly diluted the further the concept travelled. The aesthetic was always inherently unstable, in spite of the seeming level-headed self-assurance of its rhetoric.

At the most basic level, the concrete was introduced into art discourse because it helped clarify a distinctively modern, experimental style of art; one that addressed the fundamentally new conditions of contemporary living. It was a means of describing the formal properties of an art that had turned its back on established or traditional styles and genres – be they naturalism and figuration in the visual arts, or lyric verse in poetry, or melody and harmony in music. Defining a work as concrete was a way to accentuate the intensity, as well as the grounded nature, of the aesthetic experience.

In the visual arts, concrete art is almost always non-figurative. But to state that it is a subset of abstraction would be to misrepresent the way in which its early advocates, especially the Dutch painter Theo Van Doesburg and the Alsatian artist Hans or Jean Arp, came to define it. For them, the very term ‘abstraction’ was inadequate. It implied a sublation of sensory experience into a generalized realm of less tangible forms. Otto Carlsund, Van Doesburg, Jean Hélion, Léon Tutundjian and Marcel Wantz posed the rhetorical question in 1930 in their newly formed journal, Art Concret: were not a woman, a tree or a cow ‘the concrete elements in painting’? Certainly not, they declared. ‘A woman, a tree and a cow are concrete only in nature; in painting they are abstract, illusionistic, vague and speculative.’14 This led them to offer what would become one of the most famous (and thoroughly tautological) definitions of the concrete in art: ‘We speak of concrete and not abstract painting, because nothing is more concrete, more real than a line, a colour, a surface’.15 Similarly, Arp wrote: ‘we do not want to copy nature. we do not want to reproduce, we want to produce like a plant that produces a fruit and not to reproduce. we want to produce directly and not through interpretation.’ From this it followed that ‘as there is not the slightest trace of abstraction in this art, we call it: concrete art.’16 Declaring a work of art to be concrete was, in essence, a way of emphasising the particularity and facticity of the art object as an object, rich in sensual immediacy.17

During the 1950s, parallel assertions were also made by a range of poets who, informed by the terms of visual artists, fashioned a new mode of poetic diction that came to be known as ‘concrete poetry’. Clearly, though, a point-to-point conversion of principles between visual and language-based media was never going to be possible, if only because words can never be said to be plain and simple objects. (Of course it is questionable whether a line or a colour are objects in any obvious sense, but clearly it is easier to believe in this fiction if you are dealing with non-linguistic signs, as opposed to writing proper.) Invariably words stand in for other things, and so can never be treated as existing outside the realm of signification. With this in mind, concrete poetry aspired to open up the signifying capacities of language by attending to words in innovative ways, often by removing them from sentences and paragraphs and setting them down in isolation. This process involved devoting much greater levels of attention to the visual appearance of text on the page than had been the norm for more traditional literary forms. As the German critic Max Bense explained, the semantic dimension of a concrete poem was not constituted by ordering words in linear, grammatical ways, but arose through ‘visual connections’. Words were therefore now not mere ‘supports of signification’, but had become ‘a concrete element of composition’.18 In this context the adjective ‘concrete’ seems to imply something similar to ‘active’ or ‘substantive’. Indeed, it was on similar grounds that the Swiss poet Eugen Gomringer could propose that this new form of poetry treated words ‘as a totality […] – an intelligible object treated with concrete intentions as a useful thing’.19

It was in Portugese-speaking Brazil, however, that the concrete aesthetic can genuinely be said to have transformed the direction of the nation's literary scene, and given rise to a radical new form of poetics. The younger brother of Augusto de Campos, Haroldo, who was also a poet, testified to this when he insisted that the moment had come when this new tendency in literature had attained an equivalent level of self-confidence as it had already achieved in the visual arts. If, he wrote, a painter such as Cordiero could proclaim that concrete art was ‘now as real as an apple’, and not even bother to state that such work was non-figurative, then so too concrete poetry had attained a standing in which it no longer felt obliged to define itself as being in opposition to traditional modes of syntax. Instead, it held ‘sway based on its own norms, based on its own conditions’, settled as these were ‘in the concrete roots of language’.20

Tracking back to the visual arts, we might make a further observation about the assertiveness of the concretist aesthetic. Once the claim had been made that this art celebrated the plain facticity of the object (‘as real as an apple’), then it also became possible to assert that such work was ethically superior to those forms of art that might aspire to be representational. ‘The raw material of representational art has always been illusion’, we read, for instance, in the 1946 ‘Interventionist Manifesto’ of the Argentinian group Arte Concreto-Invención, which was led by the painter Tomás Maldonado.21 And because they believed that their own angular shaped, stridently coloured canvases existed beyond the realm of representation, they saw their art as free from illusions of space, expression, reality and movement, enabling them to insist that concrete art ‘makes people relate directly to real things not to fabrications’.22 This dream of an encounter with an art object that would be direct and unmediated by language or representation is a powerful aspiration within modernism, and it was one in which concrete art was heavily invested.

Concrete artists, however, were not satisfied with merely celebrating the art object for its thing-like particularity, equivalent in status to other physical artefacts in the world. They also looked to authenticate the object in a realm that transcended the individual, and so would not be tied up with expressions of subjective emotions. They thus wanted to ground the object on impersonal, a priori laws, and aspired to make art that would be objective and universal. This explains the preponderance of articles on concrete art that were devoted to discussing themes such as ‘science and technology in relation to art’, ‘structure and art’ or ‘art and mathematics’. It also explains the renewal of interest among many concrete artists in the Dutch de Stijl painter, Georges Vantongerloo, whom they claimed as a precedent. Back in the early decades of the century, Vantongerloo had propounded the view that colour proportions could be mathematically determined.23 Piet Mondrian had dismissed this scientistic approach, believing that chromaticism was a much more intuitive matter. Yet Vantongerloo had insisted that art deserved to be ordered rationally, and would frequently give his works mathematical formulae for titles, as though his forms were the exemplification of a generalized, objective system.24 It was an ideal that subsequent artists would pursue further. Indeed, by far the longest piece of writing in the 1930 magazine Art Concret consisted of an essay by the painter Jean Hélion that was dedicated to ‘Art and Mathematics’, in which he insisted that just as the goal of mathematics was to concretize the laws of logic in formulas, so painting was committed to the equivalent task through the use of colour.25

However, colour proved a difficult phenomenon to objectify, and the tendency of the early concrete artists, particularly Van Doesburg in around 1930, was to restrict the paint palette to white and grey. For Van Doesburg, it was the grid that served to convey a sense of art's objective rationalism. In his painting and graphic work from this period, he divided the canvas into a lattice of 124 squares, and distributed planes of colour diagonally, with their proportions following a scaled ratio. He believed that art should be preconceived in the mind, in order that the execution of the work could be realized as though it were a mere technical procedure. That meant using materials sparingly and attempting to conceal signs of handicraft, so as to ensure that facture did not detract attention from the underlying, intellectual rationale.

Following Van Doesburg's premature death from a heart attack in 1931, it was Bill who would go on to build on these methods the most systematically. An important series of lithographs, which he produced between 1935 and 1938, titled ‘Fifteen Variations on a Single Theme’, charts the way in which a geometrical configuration could be modified to form fifteen different visual realizations. The initial sequence consists of a single line that unfolds from a triangle, to a square, to a polygon and so on, until it becomes an octagon. The position of the points formed at the angles of the arrangement then provided him with a set of coordinates that he used to generate an array of colour planes, designs of straight and curved lines and spirals. To accompany each permutation he included a brief textual description, penned in value-neutral prose, which purported to rationalize the visual transformation that he had performed.26 The ambition was to cultivate an intellectualized and cerebral art practice, which invited viewers to regard each sequence in the series as the visualization of a transparent and logical progression.

It is unlikely, however, that contemporary professional mathematicians would have been greatly impressed by the sophistication of Bill's knowledge of geometry, as, indeed, the artist was all too aware. In a widely circulated essay, he explained that his aim was not to do ‘mathematics in itself’, but to explore a ‘mathematical approach’ to art.27 Quite deliberately he kept his terms vague and merely insinuated that there was an analogy between the development of mathematics and the natural sciences and the progress of art. Euclidian geometry and the laws of Archimedes were now widely understood to possess only limited validity, and, thanks to the likes of Lobatschevsky and Riemann, the horizons of knowledge had advanced, he wrote. Raphael and Seurat had created works in and of their time, but the new art ‘has entered many domains to which it formally had no access’.28 He was implying, in other words, that his art partook of the same spirit of research and discovery as the mathematical sciences, without stipulating with any clarity what those discoveries might be. Essentially, it was a bid for legitimacy; a way of claiming that contemporary concrete artists deserved a faculty seat at the modern technocratic university, alongside the theoretical physicists, electrical engineers and material scientists who were believed to be reshaping the horizons of possibility of western liberal democracies. Art's proper function, he insisted, was to make rational thought perceptible.

It goes without saying that, during the 1950s, the allure of this stance for artists and intellectuals in German-speaking countries was considerable. The progressive agenda concrete art provided afforded many a resource for distancing themselves from the disastrous legacies of European fascism. Principles of rationalism, bathed in an aura of scientific optimism, were perceived as a healthy and necessary alternative to the emotive, myth-laden orientation that National Socialism had espoused for the arts.29

Concrete art was therefore two things at once. It was an outlook, or an orientation, that embraced objectivity and universalism as a positive and enabling force. But it also advocated that attention should be paid to the visual properties of a particular object. And the simultaneous focus on the specificity of formal attributes as well as grand, immaterial ideals had a tendency to lead to an unstable and potentially paradoxical discourse. Texts on concrete art are often inclined to leap from detailed practicalities to the most nebulous of terms. Take, once again, the journal Art Concret. Point three of the statement ‘The Basis of Concrete Painting’, which comes at the start of the publication, states that a painting should be constructed from planes and colours that have no other meaning than what they are by themselves. Yet this insistence on the non-symbolising status of individual painterly marks did not prevent Van Doesburg from stating, a few pages later, that art was ‘the spiritual transformation of material’.30 The suggestion that an object can be both itself and a transubstantiation of spirit attests to the somewhat roundabout and contradictory ways in which concrete artworks came to convey meaning.

Arp's art is a case in point. His decision to explain his work through reference to the concrete principle was undoubtedly inspired by Van Doesburg and Hélion, whom he knew well.31 Yet, being more sympathetic to the surrealists, he was less enamoured of the spirit of rationalism and technological progress.32 For this reason Arp is often excluded from wider discussions about concrete art, although in many respects his work raises the same interpretative challenges that we encounter in other manifestations of the concrete aesthetic. </p>
